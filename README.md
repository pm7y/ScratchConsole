# ScratchConsole

For when you need a simple console starter app as a playground to explore an idea, but can't be bothered to write a bunch of boilerplate code first.

It has the following as a basis to build on: -

- DI & appsettings configuration via _CreateApplicationBuilder_
- Logging via Serilog
- A simple starter DbContext for db access

## TODO Maybe?

- Repository
- Mediatr
- DbUp or EF migrations
- Get auth token and call external api
- Tests?
